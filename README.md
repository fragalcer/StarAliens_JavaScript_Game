# COMP1720 assignment 3

Here's the template repo for COMP1720 assignment 3, see the course website for
more details:

<https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/assignments/03-simple-arcade-game/>

## Setup

1. install [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Windows, OSX or Linux)

2. install
   the
   [Git Plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus),
   [Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
   and [Color Picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) packages (if you
   use the `apm` tool it's just `apm install git-plus atom-live-server color-picker`)

## Use

1. clone this repository somewhere

2. open the folder in Atom and start the atom live server (`Packages >
   atom-live-server > Start server` or `Ctrl+Alt+L`)

3. in Chrome, type `localhost:3000` into the address bar to run/view the sketch

4. every time you save the `sketch.js` file, the live server will auto-update
   the sketch in Chrome

### Notes

This should work in all browsers, but we'll be using Chrome/Chromium in the
labs, so it's probably best to use that.

Also, if you do make a cool sketch, don't push the changes back up to the
"template" repo (you probably don't have permission to do that anyway). Instead,
create a new GitLab repo and push it up there.
